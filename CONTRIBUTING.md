# Contribution Guide

Considering contributing? Thank you so much!

## Filing Issues

The most helpful thing you can do is let us know if something is wrong or doesn't make sense.

If you have time, file an [Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/oamerge/oamerge/issues).

## Pull Requests

In order to protect the [public domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Domain) status of this project, all pull requests will be automatically closed and ignored.

At some point it is hoped that an automated license signing mechanism will be implemented, to assert the public domain nature of this software, but until then please [file an issue](https://github.com/oamerge/oamerge/issues) to suggest changes.
